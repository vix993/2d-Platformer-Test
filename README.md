# 2d-Platformer-Test

This 2d platformer is an application of some Game Developement concepts.

My motivation was to apply these concepts and create some functional mechanics.

I implemented the A* pathfinding project to get a functioning AI.

For my character movement I used the Unity 2d Standard Assets pack Player2DController script.

Everything else was built using C# and Unity resources.
